Academic project "Searching public information of law cases."

Pandas is used to extract information from an Excel database. The code iterates through the Excel file and searches the website to determine whether each person's name is associated with a registered law case. If a law case is found, the code creates a new updated Excel file containing the corresponding statistical information.
